## What is Hub Cultural?

*Hub Cultural* is a platform designed to promote culture and shed light on subcultures that are often overlooked by the mainstream.

Recife is a city rich in culture, but beyond its main stream of events lies a diverse and vibrant universe that remains unseen and unknown to much of the population.

That’s where *Hub Cultural* comes in — a space dedicated to sharing information and helping people discover unique cultural events that are not easily found elsewhere.
